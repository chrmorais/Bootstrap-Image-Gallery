This is a dumbed-down minimum-moving-parts fork of the
[Bootstrap Image Gallery Demo](http://blueimp.github.com/Bootstrap-Image-Gallery/).

* All css and js files are included (no cdn and such)
* `gallery.json` defines the content (very simple format)
* Small example `pics/` and `thumnails/` folders are included to get you going (you also need to edit `gallery.json` when you change that content).

This is good for quick "fire and forget" static galleries.
If you want to use this in anything bigger than that - you'd better fork [the original project](https://github.com/blueimp/Bootstrap-Image-Gallery#readme).
